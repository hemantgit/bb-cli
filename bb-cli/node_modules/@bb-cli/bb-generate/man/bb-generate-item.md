## DESCRIPTION:

The item will be generated into a directory named the same as the name you
give to the item when prompted.

- bb-generate requires that you have already installed Backbase generators, which is most easily done using npm.
- For most generators, the name you give will be automatically turned to snake-case.

## EXAMPLES:

Generate from installed generator:

```bash
  npm install -g @backbase/generator-widget
  bb-generate widget
```

Generate from file system:
```
  bb-generate /path/to/custom/generator
```

Output to a custom path (default output will be current directory):

```bash
  bb-generate widget-bb-ng --output /path/to/my/widgets
```
